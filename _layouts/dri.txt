My work spans the design, optimization, alignment, and evaluation of LLMs and VLMs; evaluation metric analysis and validation; audio deep learning; reinforcement learning; and AI ethics and fairness. 



I'm currently working as an independent researcher, primarily contributing to projects at Cohere Labs and Traversaal AI. My work spans the design, optimization, alignment, and evaluation of LLMs and VLMs; evaluation metric analysis and validation; audio deep learning; reinforcement learning; and AI ethics and fairness. Currently, I'm actively involved in building a spatially-aware VLM, evaluating biomedical model merging techniques and multilingual code summarization. 

Previously, I spent nearly four years as an Intellectual Property (IP) researcher, analyzing inventions related to antennas, wireless charging systems, user experience devices, and audio technologies - all at the intersection of electronics and AI. My foundation in electronics and communication engineering continues to guide my work in areas like Audio Signal Processing and Computer Vision.
