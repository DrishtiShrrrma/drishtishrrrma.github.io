excerpt: "This work presents a scalable method for generating non-licensed, synthetic instruction datasets to support multilingual LLM development, with a focus on Hindi. Through LLM distillation, Wikipedia-based context generation, and FLAN-based translation, we created over 270K high-quality instructions in English and Hindi. Our approach avoids licensed content and is fully open-source to benefit the broader community working on low-resource languages."
