excerpt: "This work presents robust, fine-grained models for detecting AI-generated text in multilingual contexts, trained and evaluated on a large-scale dataset of 2.4 million samples spanning various languages and content domains. The models are designed to distinguish between human- and LLM-generated content, detect subtle patterns in generation style and structure, and function effectively across diverse languages and scripts. Performance is benchmarked in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, with analysis of model sensitivity to generation source, prompt format, and language complexity. This research advances the development of reliable defenses against synthetic content in high-stakes multilingual applications.

This work presents robust and fine-grained models for detecting AI-generated text in multilingual settings.

We train and evaluate models on a large-scale dataset comprising **2.4 million samples** spanning multiple languages and content domains. The models are designed to:

- Distinguish between human and LLM-generated content
- Detect nuanced patterns in generation style and structure
- Operate effectively across languages and scripts

We benchmark performance across both zero-shot and fine-tuned setups and report model sensitivity to generation source, prompt format, and language complexity.

This work contributes toward building reliable defenses against synthetic content in high-stakes multilingual applications.
