excerpt: "This project introduces an multi-agent educational assistant designed to deliver personalized, multilingual, and story-driven learning experiences. Built using LangGraph and Cohereâ€™s multilingual embeddings, the system supports topic decomposition, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and narrative-based explanations. It breaks down complex subjects into structured subtopics, retrieves reliable content from academic sources, and explains them through engaging, multilingual storytelling. Currently supporting English, Hindi, and Spanish, the agent demonstrates strong baseline reasoning and holds promise for expanding educational accessibility across diverse linguistic and pedagogical contexts."
