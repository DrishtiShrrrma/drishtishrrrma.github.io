excerpt: "This work investigates the impact of cultural and local knowledge on improving multilingual LLM performance by instruction-tuning seven open-source models using a dataset of 485,000 culturally-informed English-Hindi instruction pairs spanning social norms, local customs, regional metaphors, and daily linguistic context. The study demonstrates consistent improvements in translation quality, instruction alignment, and cultural contextuality, with evaluations conducted on both standard multilingual benchmarks and custom regional knowledge probes. It also highlights the shortcomings of generic pretraining in handling culturally sensitive reasoning, emphasizing the value of localized, bilingual instruction tuning in enhancing cross-cultural fluency in language models."

This work explores the role of **cultural and local knowledge** in enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

We instruction-tuned **seven open-source LLMs** using a dataset of **485,000 culturally-informed English-Hindi instruction pairs**, covering domains such as:

- Social norms  
- Local customs  
- Regional metaphors  
- Daily linguistic context

### Key contributions:

- Demonstrated consistent gains in translation quality, instruction alignment, and cultural contextuality.
- Evaluated models on both standard multilingual benchmarks and custom regional knowledge probes.
- Highlighted limitations of generic pretraining for culturally sensitive reasoning.

The study underscores the value of **localized, bilingual instruction tuning** for improving cross-cultural fluency in LLMs.
