excerpt: "Instruction-tuning LLMs with culturally-grounded English-Hindi pairs to improve multilingual alignment and understanding."
---

This work explores the role of **cultural and local knowledge** in enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

We instruction-tuned **seven open-source LLMs** using a dataset of **485,000 culturally-informed English-Hindi instruction pairs**, covering domains such as:

- Social norms  
- Local customs  
- Regional metaphors  
- Daily linguistic context

### Key contributions:

- Demonstrated consistent gains in translation quality, instruction alignment, and cultural contextuality.
- Evaluated models on both standard multilingual benchmarks and custom regional knowledge probes.
- Highlighted limitations of generic pretraining for culturally sensitive reasoning.

The study underscores the value of **localized, bilingual instruction tuning** for improving cross-cultural fluency in LLMs.
