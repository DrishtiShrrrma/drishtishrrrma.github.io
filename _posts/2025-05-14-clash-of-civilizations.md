excerpt: "This work explores political bias in multilingual LLMs using a generative stance evaluation framework. By prompting five open-source models across 10 languages and 12 politically sensitive topics—including AI regulation, nationalism, and public services—we measure how models express stances through generated text. Our findings reveal significant cross-linguistic variability in political leaning, highlighting the limitations of existing bias evaluations and the need for more culturally aware, language-inclusive audits."
