excerpt: "This project investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) interpret global graffiti through culturally and geographically grounded prompts. The evaluation includes: (1) a cross-family comparison of architectures like InternVL, SmolVLM2, Gemini, and Qwen-VL, and (2) intra-family tracking within the InternVL series. Using prompts translated into five languages (Twi, Hindi, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese), the study explores model accuracy in regional classification, emotional inference, recognition of cultural symbols like Adinkra, and clustering of artists by style. Results reveal inconsistent geographic tagging, limited cultural sensitivity, and challenges in sentiment understandingâ€”highlighting major gaps in VLM interpretability and cultural robustness."
