excerpt: "This work explores the performance and alignment challenges of multilingual vision-language reward models. We introduce Multimodal-RewardBench—a human-annotated, translated benchmark spanning 23 languages—and evaluate both generative and discriminative models in diverse multilingual settings. Our findings reveal inconsistent reward model behavior, greater safety risks in low-resource languages, and performance degradation in visual-linguistic alignment. Discriminative and reasoning-based VLMs show promising potential, particularly in multilingual contexts where standard generative models underperform."
